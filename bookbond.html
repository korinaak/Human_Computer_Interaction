        <p>The main idea is to create an application where book lovers can exchange books based on their interests.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p>When a user downloads the app, they take a quiz on well-known books by tapping (if they like the book) or swiping (if they don’t like the book). This way, they’ll select a genre, and after a few more swipes, the app will match them with another user who has chosen similar books. To continue, the user must place a designated "Box Now" (located near their home) where they’ll be required to send a book to another user who shares the same taste in books. Additionally, the user can select a preferred age range to which they want to send the book, fostering a shared reading experience between age groups.</p>
